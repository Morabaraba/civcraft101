# Civcraft 101

This is a area for me to keep my notes as I explore [Civcraft][1]. Please see the [Civcraft Wiki][2] for more indepth information.

## Securing Stuff

You need to create groups to secure stuff in a group(to share with your friends. Civcraft use a mod called [NameLayer][3]. To create a group:

`/nlcg <group-name>`

Invite some friends:

`/nlip group-name <player-name> member`

Now to reinforce stuff:

> If you haven't placed it, hold smoothstone, iron or diamond and type `/ctf` then place the door.
>
> If you have placed it, hold smoothstone, iron or diamond and type `/ctr` then click the door.
>
> Will it tell me that the door or chest is locked? Type `/cti` and click the door again to check.
